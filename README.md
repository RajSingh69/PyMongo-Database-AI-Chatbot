# HOW TO START THE CODE

When everything is all set up:

3) All packages are installed
4) Code developer has been contacted for missing .env file. This file is not uploaded as it contains VERY sensitive information.
5) Press run like normal. :)

# Software needed to run this script

1) Python - This is the language the database is coded in (regarding the interaction). Use most recent version.
2) IDE - This is for easier viewing and additional coding if needed

# Packages used to run this project

1) os - Used with the operating system and allows for extra commands.
2) pprint - pprint (pretty print) is used for printing data in a nicer way
3) pymongo - The python addition for MongoDB

# How to access the database

Due to security concerns, I have created a separate document on how to access the database.
This document will be sent to those individuals who have clearance to access the database and it's contents.
